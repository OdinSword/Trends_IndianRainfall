This Analysis contains the Partial Correlations applied between CMIP5 historical simulations and SOI/IOD index to exclude the 
influences arising from each other. Further, the IMD Monthly data is divided into the 4 homogenous rainfall regions NWI, 
NEI, CEI and SPI and the rainfall anomalies and correlations are calculated for these data.
